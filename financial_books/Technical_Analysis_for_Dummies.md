### Here are a few tidbits that may answer some questions before you jump in

* “The point of technical analysis is to help you observe prices in a new way and to make trading decisions based on reasonable expectations about where “the market” is going to take the price.”

* “Each trade has two parts — the price analysis and you. Price analysis tools are called indicators, and you have to select the indicators that match your personality and preference for risk. But most people don't know their risk preference when they start out in securities trading (which changes over time, anyway), so you have a chicken-and-egg situation. By studying the kinds of profit and loss outcomes that each type of indicator delivers, you can figure out your risk preferences”

* “The price bar and its placement on the chart deliver a ton of information about market sentiment. It doesn't take much practice to start reading the mind of the market by looking at bars and small patterns. The payoff is cold, hard cash, but you have to be patient, imaginative, and thoughtful.”
* “Math indicators are the workhorses of technical analysis. They help you identify whether your price is trending, the strength of the trend, and when the trend is at a reversal point. Applying these indicators carefully and consistently is the key to trading success. If you're mathematically competent, you can take a giant leap into system building, and remove most of the day-to-day judgmental decision making that trading involves.”

### Choosing a trading style
In general, trading styles are a function of the holding period, or how much time elapses between buying and selling the security.

* **Position traders** identify big-picture trends lasting weeks and months, and are willing to sit out retracements and sideways range-trading situations until they resolve back into a trend. Position traders hold securities for weeks, months, and years

* **Swing traders** buy at relative lows and sell at relative highs, with “trend” defined as any move that indicators show is likely to persist for some additional time. Swing traders have a holding period of three to ten days, although analysts argue over the “right” holding period.

* **Day traders** are a sub-set of swing traders who prefer to get in and out in a single day, sometimes more than once. Day traders apply indicators to short-terms charts such as the 5-minute, 15-minute, and one-hour chart in order to identify micro-trends that may last only two or three hours. The micro-trend will often be a counter-trend to the big-picture trend on the daily chart.

* **Scalpers** have a holding period of seconds and minutes. Originally the term scalping referred to taking advantage of the bid-offer spread available by different parties or parties in different places, but with the advent of super-fast computer programs, scalping now includes algorithmic trading that automatically places rule-based buy and sell orders based on a few seconds’ advantage in obtaining information or identifying a technical pattern.

To embrace technical analysis is to embrace a way of thinking that's always sensitive to risk. Technical trading means to trade with a plan that identifies the potential gain and the potential loss of every trade ahead of time. The technical trader devises rules for dealing with price developments as they occur in order to realize the plan. In fact, you select your technical tools specifically to match your trading style with your sensitivity to risk.


# The truth about buy-and-hold
Buy-and-hold is a philosophy that says most equities are best left unattended for long periods of time in your portfolio. 

reason why buy-and-hold:

    They rise more or less in sync with the overall economy, saving you transactions costs and taxes. Besides, the market is efficient, meaning every security price already incorporates all the information available and is priced correctly. There is no point in selling Security X unless you need money for a nonmarket reason.

reason why not:

    “One reason to distrust buy-and-hold is that over really long periods, returns are not very good at al”

In other words, to buy and hold securities for a long period of time is a well-documented path to accumulating capital, but only if you got in at the best time . Otherwise, buy-and-hold is a path to the poorhouse

Also, insider trading would not be so profitable (and periodically scandalous) if all information were available immediately. This is why **securities analysts follow pharmaceutical and high-tech companies with a microscope — to get the news first. Not everyone can afford to keep up on all the news all the time about their securities**.

# The Trend Is Your Friend

“A trend is a discernible directional bias in the price — upwards, downwards, or sideways.”

# De-cluttering your mind

All known information consists of hundreds of factors ranging from accurate facts to opinions, guesses, and emotions — and previous prices. They all go into the supply and demand for a security and result in its price.

however, that prices on a chart don't tell you anything about the underlying value of the security. Where the price “should” be is a totally different subject, named fundamental analysis. Most technical traders use both forms of analysis, because technical analysis isn't antithetical to fundamental analysis, as some critics think. The two are compatible and can be used together. Many analysts choose to trade only the highest-quality securities on a fundamental basis, but time purchases and sales according to technical criteria.

* Securities prices move in trends much of the time.
* Trends can be identified with patterns that you see repeatedly and with support and resistance trendlines
*  Primary trends (lasting months or years) are punctuated by secondary movements (lasting weeks or months) in the opposite direction of the primary trend. Secondary trends, today called retracements, are the very devil to deal with as a trader.
*  Trends remain in place until some major event comes along to stop them.

At the most basic level, your goal as a technical trader is to **sit on your hands while the security is falling and wait to identify the reversal point** — the best place to buy (shown in the circle) — as early as possible

In your quest to define trendedness and formulate trading rules to maximize profits and reduce risk, don't run the risk of turning into an obsessed, nerdy number cruncher. Don't forget that behind the numbers are other human beings who often behave in irrational ways. Technical analysis (so far) remains an art, not a science, even when it uses scientific methods.

The biggest mistake that beginning technical traders make is attributing too much reliability and accuracy to technical methods. Experienced technical traders know that no technique works all the time. In fact, many techniques work only when the majority of market participants believe that they will work, forming a self-fulfilling prophecy. You needn't care whether the theory is valid. Your goal is to make money, not to be scientifically pure.

Technical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior in order to **join the crowd and take advantage of its momentum**. This phenomenon is called the bandwagon effect”
