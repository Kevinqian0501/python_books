### Here are a few tidbits that may answer some questions before you jump in

* “The point of technical analysis is to help you observe prices in a new way and to make trading decisions based on reasonable expectations about where “the market” is going to take the price.”

* “Each trade has two parts — the price analysis and you. Price analysis tools are called indicators, and you have to select the indicators that match your personality and preference for risk. But most people don't know their risk preference when they start out in securities trading (which changes over time, anyway), so you have a chicken-and-egg situation. By studying the kinds of profit and loss outcomes that each type of indicator delivers, you can figure out your risk preferences”

* “The price bar and its placement on the chart deliver a ton of information about market sentiment. It doesn't take much practice to start reading the mind of the market by looking at bars and small patterns. The payoff is cold, hard cash, but you have to be patient, imaginative, and thoughtful.”
* “Math indicators are the workhorses of technical analysis. They help you identify whether your price is trending, the strength of the trend, and when the trend is at a reversal point. Applying these indicators carefully and consistently is the key to trading success. If you're mathematically competent, you can take a giant leap into system building, and remove most of the day-to-day judgmental decision making that trading involves.”

### Choosing a trading style
In general, trading styles are a function of the holding period, or how much time elapses between buying and selling the security.

* **Position traders** identify big-picture trends lasting weeks and months, and are willing to sit out retracements and sideways range-trading situations until they resolve back into a trend. Position traders hold securities for weeks, months, and years

* **Swing traders** buy at relative lows and sell at relative highs, with “trend” defined as any move that indicators show is likely to persist for some additional time. Swing traders have a holding period of three to ten days, although analysts argue over the “right” holding period.

* **Day traders** are a sub-set of swing traders who prefer to get in and out in a single day, sometimes more than once. Day traders apply indicators to short-terms charts such as the 5-minute, 15-minute, and one-hour chart in order to identify micro-trends that may last only two or three hours. The micro-trend will often be a counter-trend to the big-picture trend on the daily chart.

* **Scalpers** have a holding period of seconds and minutes. Originally the term scalping referred to taking advantage of the bid-offer spread available by different parties or parties in different places, but with the advent of super-fast computer programs, scalping now includes algorithmic trading that automatically places rule-based buy and sell orders based on a few seconds’ advantage in obtaining information or identifying a technical pattern.

To embrace technical analysis is to embrace a way of thinking that's always sensitive to risk. Technical trading means to trade with a plan that identifies the potential gain and the potential loss of every trade ahead of time. The technical trader devises rules for dealing with price developments as they occur in order to realize the plan. In fact, you select your technical tools specifically to match your trading style with your sensitivity to risk.


# The truth about buy-and-hold
Buy-and-hold is a philosophy that says most equities are best left unattended for long periods of time in your portfolio. 

reason why buy-and-hold:

    They rise more or less in sync with the overall economy, saving you transactions costs and taxes. Besides, the market is efficient, meaning every security price already incorporates all the information available and is priced correctly. There is no point in selling Security X unless you need money for a nonmarket reason.

reason why not:

    “One reason to distrust buy-and-hold is that over really long periods, returns are not very good at al”

In other words, to buy and hold securities for a long period of time is a well-documented path to accumulating capital, but only if you got in at the best time . Otherwise, buy-and-hold is a path to the poorhouse
