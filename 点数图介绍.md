**Point and figure charts**
have been in use for over 100 years, yet they exist in relative obscurity compared to bar charts and candlesticks. Their usefulness lies in their ability to **filter out market “noise”**—short-term price fluctuations that occur during longer, more established trends. They differ from the more conventional charts in that **they ignore the passage of time and do not take trading volume into account**—they are only affected by price movements.

    优点：分析信号的时候可以通过调参数的设定来实现过滤掉噪声的目的

The box size is based on the scale you wish to use for a particular security or index and it represents the value given to each box (X or O) on the chart. It is the **minimum price** change needed to continue the trend—i.e., to add an X to the top of the column of X’s (or the minimum price decrease needed to add an O to the bottom of a column of O’s). The reason that this is even an issue is because a reversal of 3 dollar for a 10 dollar stock is more dramatic, on a different scale, than a 3 dollar reversal on a 100 dollar stock. Furthermore, since point and figure charts are used to filter out “noise” in the market, **you will want to be sure that you are filtering out just enough to eliminate momentary price reversals, yet at the same time allow enough through so you can identify when a significant reversal is taking place**.

    使用技巧：调参数设定需要经验，既不能留下太多的噪声，又不能把反转信号过滤掉。这个主要有两个设置可以调。 Box size 和 reverse scale。

### 1.1 box sizes

     box sizes ： have traditionally been broken down into the following levels:

| Price Range        | Box Size    | 
| --------   | -----:   | 
| Under 0.25        | 0.0625      |   
| 0.25 to 1.00        | 0.125      |   
| 1.00 to 5.00        | 0.25      |  
| 5.00 to 20.00        | 0.50      |  
| 20.00 to 100        | 1.00      |  
| 100 to 200        | 2.00     |  
| 200 to 500        | 4.00     |  
| 500 to 1,000        | 5.00    | 
| 1,000 to 25,000        | 50.00    | 
| 25,000 and up        | 500.00    | 



box size 还可以是按百分比（比如上涨或下跌百分之一为一个格子），或者固定格子来画

### 1.2 Reverse scale

Reverse scale： How you move from one column to another is key to your analysis of point and figure charts. The way in which you move to a new column is called the “reversal method.” The **reversal amount** determines how many boxes the price must reverse course in order to move to a new column and switch from X’s to O’s or O’s to X’s. While this can be left to the individual creating the chart, the **typical reversal is the “three box” reversal**, because it is thought to eliminate spurious price fluctuations and focus on only “significant” price movements.

# 2， 怎么使用点数图

Now that we have gone through the process of creating a point and figure chart, the next step is to understand how to use this chart as part of your investment decision-making process. The main use of point and figure analysis involves **trendline and chart patterns**.

### 2.1 Trendlines

**Trendlines** are useful when examining any type of chart because they allow you to determine those price levels where buyers are willing to support a security by buying, as well as those areas where sellers depress the price by selling. With point and figure charts, **drawing trendlines is easier than with other charts because much of the subjectivity is eliminated.**


There are four different types of trendlines you can use with point and figure charts:

    Bullish support
    Bearish resistance.

Trendlines 可以用来判断大体的走势， 有时候会出现反转， 这个时候画线的话需要判断是否反转，如果出现反转信号的话就需要变换trendline 类型了。

还有其他的indicator，比如平均价格，多列平均等等， 对投资判断价格走势有很大的参考价值

### 2.2 Chart patterns

One of the main objectives of technical and chart analysis is to identify trends in price and/or volume that may be used to predict future price movements. Some of the more popular and frequently occurring chart patterns are **double tops and bottoms**, as well as **bullish and bearish triangles**.

    所有的pattern中，double tops and bottoms 出现是最频繁的。做分析的时候可以用来预判近期的走势。

**bullish and bearish triangles**， At this point, you have no idea which way the price may go if it were to break out of the formation, meaning you must wait for the pattern to be confirmed before entering your trade

    bullish and bearish triangles 这个信号出现的次数不多，但是是一个很重要的信号，我把收敛的线段也都画出来了，这个信号出现的时候，接下来一般会有比较强劲的上涨或者下跌。

Overall, the formation of a triangle, with its series of lower lows and higher highs, signals the potential that prices will ‘break out.” The formation of a double top or double bottom gives an indication of the direction of the breakout.

    bull/bear reverse signal以及其他的trap和catapults信号出现的频率都很低，可以和往期对比，对接下来的走势做分析

# 3， 总结


• **No time axis** - unlike bar or candlestick charts, p&f charts have no horizontal time axis ñ only price
change generates chart action.


• **The 3 Box reversal rule**（使用得最多） - P&F charts will not change direction (i.e. from a column of Xs to a column of Os) unless the price moves more than 3 boxes (or unit of price) in the opposite direction. There can
therefore be no fewer than three boxes in a column. This reversal technique is one of the key strengths
to p&f charting as it effectively filters out minor fluctuations to reveal patterns.


• **Clear cut signals** what makes p&f charts so popular is the clarity of signal: each stock is either on a
buy or on a sell and identifying when this signal changes is well-defined and easy to spot.

• **Support/resistance levels** easy to identify due to the almost diagrammatic box format.

• **Stop and target levels are calculated for every breakout signal** 画图很容易

Point and figure charts are an interesting way of examining the **basic economic principle** of supply and demand. By **eliminating the time element** from the chart, you are left to **focus strictly on price movements**. By using reversal methods such as the three-point reversal, you are also able to **filter out the market noise that can sometimes generate false information regarding trend reversals**.

Taking point and figure analysis one step further, some relatively basic principles, such as trendlines as well as pattern formations such as tops, bottoms, and triangles, can be helpful in gauging buy and sell decisions.
